  - [Neural Scene Flow Fields for Space-Time View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes, CVPR2021](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~zl548/NSFF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zhengqili/Neural-Scene-Flow-Fields)
    > We present a method to perform novel view and time synthesis of dynamic scenes, requiring only a monocular video with known camera poses as input. To do this, we introduce Neural Scene Flow Fields, a new representation that models the dynamic scene as a time-variant continuous function of appearance, geometry, and 3D scene motion. Our representation is optimized through a neural network to fit the observed input views. We show that our representation can be used for complex dynamic scenes, including thin structures, view-dependent effects, and natural degrees of motion. We conduct a number of experiments that demonstrate our approach significantly outperforms recent monocular view synthesis methods, and show qualitative results of space-time view synthesis on a variety of real-world videos.
  - [Neural 3D Video Synthesis from Multi-view Video, CVPR2022(oral)](https://neural-3d-video.github.io/) | [code]
    > We propose a novel approach for 3D video synthesis that is able to represent multi-view video recordings of a dynamic real-world scene in a compact, yet expressive representation that enables high-quality view synthesis and motion interpolation. Our approach takes the high quality and compactness of static neural radiance fields in a new direction: to a model-free, dynamic setting. At the core of our approach is a novel time-conditioned neural radiance fields that represents scene dynamics using a set of compact latent codes. To exploit the fact that changes between adjacent frames of a video are typically small and locally consistent, we propose two novel strategies for efficient training of our neural network: 1) An efficient hierarchical training scheme, and 2) an importance sampling strategy that selects the next rays for training based on the temporal variation of the input videos. In combination, these two strategies significantly boost the training speed, lead to fast convergence of the training process, and enable high quality results. Our learned representation is highly compact and able to represent a 10 second 30 FPS multi-view video recording by 18 cameras with a model size of just 28MB. We demonstrate that our method can render high-fidelity wide-angle novel views at over 1K resolution, even for highly complex and dynamic scenes. We perform an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation that shows that our approach outperforms the current state of the art. Project website: https://neural-3d-video.github.io.
  - [Dynamic View Synthesis from Dynamic Monocular Video, ICCV2021](https://free-view-video.github.io/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/gaochen315/DynamicNeRF)
    > We present an algorithm for generating novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and any input time step given a monocular video of a dynamic scene. Our work builds upon recent advances in neural implicit representation and uses continuous and differentiable functions for modeling the time-varying structure and the appearance of the scene. We jointly train a time-invariant static NeRF and a time-varying dynamic NeRF, and learn how to blend the results in an unsupervised manner. However, learning this implicit function from a single video is highly ill-posed (with infinitely many solutions that match the input video). To resolve the ambiguity, we introduce regularization losses to encourage a more physically plausible solution. We show extensive quantitative and qualitative results of dynamic view synthesis from casually captured videos.
  - [Editable Free-Viewpoint Video using a Layered Neural Representation, SIGGRAPH2021](https://jiakai-zhang.github.io/st-nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://jiakai-zhang.github.io/st-nerf/#code)
    > Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.
